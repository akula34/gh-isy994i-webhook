Begin as close to possible to the complaining host/device to obtain round trip times and performance statistics from that perspective.
You may need to take a capure at a different point later.

****** Tips on Choosing a Caputre Location
When troubleshooting a network problem, begin as close as posslbe to the user or device that is complainining. This allows you to obtain network traffic statistics from that host's perspective.

In the example shown, Mike is experiencing performance problems communicating to 10.0.61.179. His traffic flows through a NAT/firewall device and then a load balancer.

Begin by capturing as close to Mike as possible. This may mean spann ing Mike's switch port or putting a full duplex tap in place.

Once you have identified the communication problem, you may need to move Wireshark (or setup anothe system running Wireshark) to caputre traffic closer to the source of data flow. In this example you may want to capture the traffic on the other side of the NAT/Firewall.

/FYI/: Mike's IP Address will be differnt on the other side of the NAT. You may find that the NAT/Firewall device "passes through" the same TCP Sequence Number so you can correlate Mike's traffic on one side from 10.10.10.1 with Mike's traffic on the other side from 10.3.8.109.
****** Tips for Working with Large Trace Files and High Throughput
:PROPERTIES:
:Page:     34
:END:
The following List offers some options for capturing on a high throughput network.

******* Capture at an Endpoint, not inside the Infrastructure
Since most endpoints are connected to the network via switches, you have a natural filtering mechanicsm in place. Switches won't forward unicast traffic to and from other devices on the network so you can focus in on the traffic affecting the complaining host machine.
******* Don't Overload the Switches with Spanning Responsibilities - Use TAPs
Often people avoid buying TAPs (Test Access Point Devices) because of budget concerns. They decide to just span switches instead. Unfortunately, they have just placed an extra load on the switches and need to watch out for oversubscription of the switch.
******* Apply a Capture Filter to Reduce the Load on Wireshark
Wireshark needs to process every packet captured, so consider reducing the load on Wireshark by applying a capture filter. Be aware that if your filter is too narrow you might miss the packets relating to a problem. Start with a more general capture filter if possible.
******* Watch for "Dropped" Indications in the Status Bar
When the "Dropped" inidication appears it is tim eto stop capturing with Wireshark and go to the command line capture. Even if the "Dropped" indication only shows "1" it is a sign that the capture process cannot keep up with the traffic rate. Often you will see symptoms such as "ACKed Unseen Segment" in the trace file. These trace files cannot be analyzed accurately.
******* Use Tshark or Dumpcap (with Capture Filters if Necessary)
Wireshark.exe cannot capture traffic. It calls dumpcap to do the capturing. Tshark also uses dumpcap. Tshark offers more functionality than dumpcap alone, however. That is the reason we often use Tshark because of the extra options, but if you are really short on resources, use dumpcap alone.

T-Stat does great with statistics

****** Tips for Locating the Cause of Intermittent Problems
:PROPERTIES:
:Page:     35
:END:
******* Capture at the Complaint Point (if Possible)
Again, avoid capturing inside the infrastructure. If a specific user is coplaining, capture close to that user. If it is a server that seem to have issues, capture close to that endpoint. This will allow you to take advantage of the networks's natural filtering mechanicsm. Of course, if you capture at a server you may need to apply some capture filter to remove the "known to be unassociated with the problem traffic" from the captuer.
******* Capture to File Sets
Capture to file sets to help locate the traffic around the time of the problem.
******* Base your File Set on Maximum  ~100MB File Size
I will still limit my trave file size to 100MB whenever possible. Anything larger and I notice severe performance degradation (especially with all the columns I add to Wireshark).
******* Use a Ring Buffer
Keep the most recent set of files only by defininig a ring buffer. Define the number of files based on drive space considerations. For example, if you have plenty of space you might want to save the last 100 files - but you may not need nearly this many files to spot the problem.
******* Manually Stop the Capture (if possible)
Ideally you want to stop the capture shortly after the problem has occurred. This ensures that the most recent trace files contain the traffic at the same time as the problem. When you begin your analysis, you can start at the end of the trace set and work your way backwards.
******* Obtain the Time that the Problem Occurs and Use the File Name Timestamp
Wireshark adds a timestamp to the file name based on the start of the file set capture process. If a complaining user can jot down the time when a problem occurs, you can use the timestamp value to identify the file that contains the needed traffic.
****** Tips for Naming Your Trace Files
:PROPERTIES:
:Page:     36
:END:
Fortunately, capturing in pcapng format enables you to determine if a capture filter was used during the capture process and the tool used for the capture (Statistics|Summary)

Sanitizing Traces: [[https://www.tracewrangler.com][tracewranger]] (Jasper Bongertz)
******* Include the Capture Location
Save yourself time by stating explicitly where you took the trace file. For example, if you were spanning switch 7's port 2 to switch 7's port 4, add "span_s7-2_to_s7-4" in the name. Take the time to do this and you'll be happy later.
******* Include the Purpose of the Capture
If you are focusing on a slow loging process, put that in the trace file name. It's easy to get distracted by "ugly" network traffic and forget the purpose of the trace file.
******* Include Hints in the Name
Help yourself along with the analysis by putting in any sort of hints that you can in the file name. For example, if you watched a user try to load a web page and saw the screen "paint" instead of "pop", you can put "sitepaints" in the file name. You know you are likely looking for delays in HTTP traffic.
******* Rename with -a after you've Added Annotations
Packet and trace file annotation are great features. Add an overall annotation to the trace file when you've detected the problem or just provide a bit more detail on why you took the trace. Select /Statistics | Comment Summary/ to examine all annotations.
******* Rename with a -x after Scrubbing
If your trace files contain confidential information, protect them. Don't send them to anyone and treat them like gold. If you must send them to someone (a vendor, for example), scrub the information using a HEX editor or scrubbing tool such as Trace Wrangler
******* Do no Use Names Like trace1.pcapng, trace2.pcapng (Argh!)
I've been sent trace file sets with just plane useless naming. It drives me crazy. I've also seen folks who have hundreds or thousands of trace files in a directory that stagnates because it's an overwheliming task to look through each file to figure out if it is an important file.
****** Switched Network Options
:PROPERTIES:
:Page:     37
:END:
*Capture Options for a Switched Network*
You bought a switch to help control and isolate network traffic, thereby allowing more efficient use of bandwidth. This is a great technique for reducing unecessary traffic on connected ports, but it creates anguish for the protocol analyst.

Try it out! Plug you analyzer into a switch port and classify the traffic. You'll see up to four types of traffic by default:
1. Broadcast traffic
2. Multicast Traffic
3. Traffic to and from your own hardware address
4. Traffic to an unknown hardware address

Traffic from one device connected to a switch flows directly to the destination device on another port. In the figure above, the client and server traffic flows between port 2 and 3. Their traffic is not sent down any other ports. If you plug your analyzer into the switch, you won't be able to listen into the communications because the switch is doing what it should be doing - It is isolating local converstaions based on hardware addresses. 

To listen in on the traffic to and from the host on port 2 you must either (a) span the switch port or (b) use a full-duplex tap
****** Full Duplex Taps
*Use Full-Duplex TAPs*
A TAP (Test Access Point), hereinafter referred to as simply a "tap", can be used to listen in on a full-duplex communications.

Full-duplex communications turn a one-lane road into a two-lane road with one transmit channel and one receive channel. In order to view the traffic traveling on both channels, you need a full-duplex tap.

As shown above a full-duplex aggregator tap combines the transmit (TX) and receive (RX) data stream into one RX stream
****** Use File Sets and Auto-Save
:PROPERTIES:
:Page:     39
:END:
******* Capture to a File Set in High Traffic Rate Situstions
Although most of the time you will likely capture a single file, when you capture a large amount of traffic, consider capturing to a file set and possibly using a ring buffer.

File sets are contiguous files that are saved to disk and can be accessed using *File | File Set | List Files*. If you create a file set using the file name capture.pcapng, the files will be named using the 'capture' stem, a five-digit sequential number, the year, the hour (24-hour time value), minute, seconds and the .pcapng extension. File sets taken at a five minute interval would have names similiar to the following:

capture_0001_20180519191348.pcapng
capture_0001_20180519191848.pcapng
capture_0001_20180519192348.pcapng
******* Use a Ring Buffer to Avoid Filling a Drive
A ring buffer limits the number of saved files. For example, a ring buffer of 2 would only save the last two files in a set, maitaining the sequential numbering scheme.
****** Capture Filter Lists
:PROPERTIES:
:Page:     40
:END:
******* Use Capture Filters when Necessary*
Capture filters are applied only at the time of capture to reduce the number of packets captured. For example, if you are troubleshooting a problem with a specific host, you might consider applying a filter for the host's IP address. The syntax would be host x.x.x.x.

Capture filters use the Berkeley Packet Filtering (BPF) format. This is the format used for /tcpdump/ as well. Display filters use a proprietary filter format and, except in rare instances, capture filters and display filters will use a different syntax.

Wireshark has a default set of capture filters (kept in a file called /cfilters/) that you can use as examples when creating your own capture filters.
******* *HOT TIP*
Remember that you can't "recover" packets you have filtered out of the trace file with a capture filter. Consider *NOT* applying a capture filter - use display filters to reduce the number of packets you need to wade through.
******* Sample Capture Filters
|---------------------+------------------------------------------------|

******* Offset Capture Filters
Offset capture filters enable you to capture traffic based on an offset and a value in incoming packets. Remember to start counting at zero when defining an offset.

Tip: To build and offset capture filter, open a trace file that includes a packet containing the field of interest. Highlight the field of interest in the Packet Details pane and determine the field offset using the Packet Bytes pane.

****** Part 4: TCP/IP Resolution Process
:PROPERTIES:
:Page:     47
:END:
******* TCP/IP Resolution Process
If all goes well, we are able to resolve the following information during the TCP/IP resolution process:
1. Source/destination port number
2. Destination IP Address (the source IP address is known)
3. Destination MAC address (the source MAC address is known)
******* Port Number Resolution
1. In our example, the user has typed "ftp CORPFSA1". FTP typically uses port 20 or a dynamic port to transfer data and port 21 for commands (such as login and password submission functions, USER and PASS). In our example, since the client is attempting to login, our stack would define port 21 as the appropriate port. This port number is contained in the /etc/services file. This number would be placed in the TCP header destination port field of the outbound packet. The client would use a dynamic (ephemeral) port for the source port field value.
******* Name Resolution
2. The name resolution specification dictates that you must look at the local host file first (if one exists). Next, it sends queries to the DNS (Domain Name System) server, if one has been configured for the local system. If there is no answer from the first DNS server on the configured DNS server list, the client queries the next DNS server known. Still no answer? No more DNS servers known? Then the client cannot reach the target. In our example, we may see the client send a DNS query to the first DNS server listed in the clients local configuration. We should (if all goes well) see a reply that contains CORPFS1's IP address from a DNS server.
******* Location Resolution
3. Determine if the destination address indicates that the destination device is local or remote. Upon determination of the IP address, the client should place it's own network mask on the destination address and compare the network portion of the destination address to the desired target's network address portion. In our example, the client's IP address is 10.1.0.1. Consider the possible results depending on the clients's IP address and subnet mask.
|----------------+-------------+-----------------------------|
| Source Address | Subnet Mask | Is CORPFS1 Local or Remote? |
|----------------+-------------+-----------------------------|
|      10.1.22.4 |   255.0.0.0 | Local (Go to step 4)        |
|      10.1.22.4 | 255.255.0.0 | Local (Go to step 4)        |
|      10.1.22.4 | 255.255.0.0 | Remote (go to step 5)       |
|----------------+-------------+-----------------------------|

At this point, there are two alternatives - find the MAC address of the destination (assuming the destination is local) or find the MAC address of the next-hop router that can get the packet to the destination (assuming the destination is remote).
******* Local - MAC Address Resolution
4. If the destination device is local, the client must resolve the MAC address of the local target. An IPv4 client checks ARP cache for the information. If it does not exist, the client sends an ARP broadcast looking for the target's hardware address. IPv6 clients use Neighbor Solicitation (ICMPv6) to locate a local target.
******* Remote - Route Resolution
5. If the destination device is remote, the client must perform route resolution to identify the appropriate next-hop router. The client looks in its local routing tables to determine if it has a host or network router entry for the target. If neither entry is available, the client checks for a default gateway entry.

The default gateway offers a path of 'blind faith' - since the client does not have a route to the destination, it sends the packet to the default gateway and just hopes the default gateway can figure out what to do with the packet. Default Gateways typically either forward the packet on (if they have the best route to the destination), send and ICMP reploy that points to another local router that has the best route to the destination, or reply indicating that they hve no idea where to send the packet.
******* Remote - MAC Address Resolution for a Gateway
6. Finally, the client must resolve the MAC address of the next-hop router or default gateway. IPv4 clients check their ARP cache first. If the information does not exist in cache, the IPv4 client sends an ARP broadcast out to get the MAC address of the next-hop router. IPv6 clients send router solicitation (ICMPv6) message to discover the local router.
****** Part 5: Troubleshoot with Time
******* General UDP-Based App Delay Detection
:PROPERTIES:
:Page:     51
:END:
******** Detect UDP-Based Application Delays
Packets are NOT timestamped when they first begin arriving. Packets are timestamped upon complete receipt.
Under *VIEW | Time Display Format* there are six options for displaying time in the trace file. Three of these options are the most commonly used.
******** Seconds Since Beginning of Capture (default; frame.time_relative)
This time option is the default for Wireshark. The first packet in the trace file is considered to have arrived at time 0. Each other slide is timestamped upon receipt and compared to the receipt of the first packet.
******** Seconds Since Previous Captured Packet (frame.time_delta
The time option provides the delta value between the previous captured packet and the current packet.

The third option, /Seconds Since Previous Displayed Packet/, is described on the next page.
******* Compare Timestamps of Filtered Traffic
:PROPERTIES:
:Page:     52
:END:
In many instances you will filter traffic on a specific conversation or a particular protocol. As you focus in, you may desire to track time between the displayed packets
******** Seconds Since Previous Displayed Packet (frame.time_delta_displayed)
This time option calculated the delta time from the end of one packet to the end of the next packet based on the packets shown at the time. The arrival times of any packets that are not displayed are not calculated in this time value.

**HOT TIP** Do not troubleshoot delays before user-initiated communications, such as a delay before a user name or password is sent. Also watch out for delays before connections are terminated (TCP Finish or Reset bits set) as applications can close a connection long after the user has moved onto other tasks. The user is not aware of this trailing process
******* Detect TCP Stream Delays
:PROPERTIES:
:Page:     53
:END:
Besides the general packet timestamps available in Wireshark, you can also examine timestamps based ona a single TCP stream. Any traffic not related to a TCP connection will be ignored when calculating the TCP timestamp value. TCP conversation timestamping is configured as a TCP preference setting (right click on a TCP packet: *| Protocol Preferences | Calculate conversation timestamps*
******** Compare TCP Conversation Timestamp Values
There are two Wireshark TCP Timestamp fields:
1. Time since first frame in this TCP stream (tcp.time_relative)
2. Time since previous frame in this TCP stream (tcp.time_delta)

You can create a display filter or coloring rule to detect large gaps in time within a single TCP connection based on the /tcp.time_delta/ field contents.

**Warning** Don't get confused. This is not the TCP Timestamp as defined in RFC 1323. These TCP Timestamp fields are enclosed in brackets which indicate that it is a Wireshark interpretation, not an actual TCP header field.
******* TCP Initial Round Trip (iRTT) Calculation
:PROPERTIES:
:Page:     55
:END:
Capturing in client: Capture at the client and obtain the initial Round Trip Time using the time between the SYN and the SYN/ACK
******** TCP Initial Round Trip Time (iRTT) Calculation (Capture at Client)
Now that we know we have a tcp.time_delta value (only visible if TCP's Calculate Conversation Timestamps preference is enabled)

Using that value, we can look at the tcp.time_delta time in a SYN/ACK packet to get the iRTT value.

We can also create a filter expression button to identify slow TCP iRTT values (over 500ms) in the example below:

tcp.flags.syn==1 && tcp.flags.ack==1 && tcp.time_delta >0.5
******** TCP Initial Round Trip Time (iRTT) Calculation (Captured at Server)
When capturing at the server, we are interested in the time between the SYN/ACK and the ACK. Detecting the third packet of the handshake is difficult. The following are possible characteristics of the third packet of the handshake.
1. tcp.seq==1  (Required) TCP Seq. Number 1 (Relative Seq. Number)
2. tcp.ack==1  (Required) TCP Ack. Number 1 (Relative Ack. Number)
3. tcp.len>0   (Optional) data in the third packet of the handshake
4. tcp.push==1 (Optional) PUSH bit set

The best we can do is "cast a wide net" and then either ignore (or perhaps remove) false positives from view. We can use the following filter to try and capture the third packet of the handshake:
tcp.seq==1 && tcp.ack==1

When we are looking for large delays before this packet, we can add the tcp.time_delta value.
tcp.seq==1 && tcp.ack==1 && tcp.time_delta > .5
******** TCP Initial Round Trip Time (iRTT) Calculation (Captured in Infrastructure)
Again, we know that detecting the third packet of the handshake is difficult. This time we want to know the amount of time between the first and thirda packet of the handshake. This will give us the equivalent of a full round trip time.

We can look at the third packet of the handshake and compare it with the first packet of the stream.

The imagine above illustates TCP connection, an HTTP GET request and a server responsding with HTTP data. You can use the packets in an HTTP browing session to identify wire latency and service response latency. Note that this just provides a snapshot of the time values. Additional examination should be performed.

Examine the time between the servers ACK in receipt of the GET request and the actual data packet to identify the potential server processor latency problems. Again, remember that this is simply a snapshot and additional communications should be examined to verify that high service response latency times are the problem.

The basic process can be used on any request/response-style communication.

In many cases, Wireshark has the ability to measure service response times for an application using a [app].time field.

| TCP FIN or RST packets         | An application is closing the connection after waiting a specified amount of time or upon completion of some task. The user won't even know the connection is being terminated. Do not spend time troubleshooting these. |
| A client dends a request to a server | The application requires user interaction, such as filling out a form and pressing the submit button. If user interaction is not required, then we need to examine why there is a delay in an automated process |
| A server responds with a SYN/ACK | There is high latency along the path between the client & the server   |
| A server responds with requested information after acknowledging the request | There is server processing latency. If the ACK to the request was returned quickly, then we know the server received the request. If there is a long delay before the data arrives, then we need to look at why the server is slow - perhaps that server must ask another server for information (such as in a tiered architecture). Alternatively, if these data packets come in regular intervals, it may be an application-level keep alive process |
| The next packet in a data stream | Either the sender became busy with other processing or a tiered configuration is in place and is injecting time lapses - alternatively consider that a device along the path may be buffering the data for higher priority traffic |
| An ACK from a TCP peer         | Path latency or a feature called Delayed ACK which can slow down an ACK transmission to reduce the number of ACKs required |
| A Retransmission               | Timeout waiting for an ACK or perhaps a complete path failure          |
| A keep-alive or window probe   | The target of the keep-alive or window probe packet is either being asked about the available receive buffer space or to keep a connection up even though no data is being exchanged |
| TLSv1 Encrypted Alert          | The application sending a Close command if this precedes a FIN or RST process. |
| A periodic set of packets in a connection that is otherwise idle | An application is running a keep alive process                         |

The majority of Expert Infos designations are contained in the TCP dissector at this time.

Visit www.wireshark.org and select /DEVELOP | BROWSE THE CODE/. You are now in Wireshark's Git repository. Git is the code repository, collaboration, and management system used by the Wireshark developers. Originally developed by Linus Torvalds in 2005, Git is an open source software.

At this point in the course, we will examine the TCP dissector Expert infos.
******* Sequence & Acknowledgement
:PROPERTIES:
:Page:     68
:END:
******** The TCP Sequencing/Acknowledgement Process
SYN: Any packet that has the SYN bit set - we pretend we send one byte of data. Phantom Byte.

The sequencing/acknowledgement process gurantees that the packets are ordered properly and protects against missing segments. During the handshake process, each side of the connection selects it's own starting sequence number. They will increment this sequence number by the amount of data included in each packet.


When you're analyzing the sequencing/acknowledgement process, keep in mind this simple equation: Sequence Number In + Bytes of Data Received = Acknowledgement Number Out.

*FYI*: During the TCP startup & teardown sequence there is a 'phantom byte' that causes the sequence number & acknowledgement number fields to increment by 1 even though no data is exchanged. Don't let this confuse you when you are just learning the process.

Nonce: This is a security bit used by Differentiated Services (DiffServ).

Security coloring rules first, Troubleshooting second

Six TCP Flags:
1. URG: Look at the Urgent Pointer Field, contains an offset where you should start reading the data (legacy function), not used usually and probably meant to be a PSH bit.
2. ACK: Acknowledging something or no other bit to set. If no bits are set, it's called a NULL SCAN.
3. PSH: Send this buffer now. Do not queue this data. Used on the send side, not the receive side.
   1. Full MSS Size
   2. PSH bit is set by Application
   3. Transmit timer expires.
4. RST: Closing a connection explicitly or for service refusal.
5. SYN: Synchronize sequence numbers. Used in the Initial Sequence Number (ISN) packets. Provide my sequence number to my peer on connection startup. No data allowed.
6. FIN: "I am done sending you data, but you can still send me data. If you send me a FIN, we will time out this connection."

Handshake Packets: SYN packets should be longer than 20 bytes. Options in there... At least the MSS size option should be there.

MTU: Max transmission unit (whatever can be routed)

******** Detecting Packet Loss
********* Detecting Packet Loss in Wireshark
The Wireshark dissector code defines a lost packet as follows:
"If this segment is beyond the last seen nextseg we must have missed some previous segment."
In the figure above, the Sequence number jumped from 1461 to 4381.
Sequence number 2921 is missing.

     - 2000A ATP Design: Vashi brough up that they wanted to know what we were planning on doing for the 2kA ATPs. I reiterated that other than using the MP+ breakers and new bracing designs, no changes are in the works. A separate meeting should be planned.
     - 1200A Lake Shore Electric Mitigation Testing: Expressed concern that we may not need to do 85k SS testing on the ATP and that the more important testing is on the breaker at the elbows of the curve. No specific date has been set for the testing.
     - Lashing: Testing will be done using the upstream breakers (Eaton). May not necessarily match what we've done previously. Asked Mo to chat. Described that this is not how we do it.
       + Three Shots: Two with PL & Eaton, one (1) with nothing upstream

**** Running Test Log
<2016-06-07 Tue 09:15>: Arrived and discussed the plan for the ATP. I objected to allowing them to transer it until we were able to monitor the contacts with the oscilloscope.
<2016-06-07 Tue 09:47>: Discussion with the CHG3 personnel to allow us to monitor the following:
Monitoring Points
1. Charging Motor - Aux Breaker
2. Normal Breaker Closed Aux Contact
3. Normal Breaker Open Aux Contact
4. Aux Breaker Closed Contact
5. Aux Breaker Open Contact

<2016-06-07 Tue 10:39> Discussion around power contacts versus aux contacts. Initiatl traces were connected to power contacts. Asked DCOps to move them to Aux Contacts for proper measuring purposes.
<2016-06-07 Tue 10:43> Finished up wiring the osciloscope. Monitoring way more channels than necessary or asked for.

<2016-06-07 Tue 10:45> Starting ATP Testing. Results are shown in the [[#testresults][ATP Test Results]] section.

<2016-06-07 Tue 11:14>
Beginning the lockout procedure to power off the ATPs. No brief was given to visitors.

<2016-06-07 Tue 11:32> Removing covers from the breakers to allow for excess energy testing.

<2016-06-07 Tue 12:12> Lunch

<2016-06-07 Tue 13:00> Returned from lunch. SE is still working on disconnecting the existing breakers.

<2016-06-07 Tue 15:12> Excess Energy tested on disconnected breakers. Tightening and installing bus supports now.

**** Test results on Failed ATP
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: testresults
:END:
<2016-06-07 Tue 10:45>

Transfers were manually initiated using the Preferred Mode Selector (PSS) from Normal to Alternate.

***** Test 1
ATP closed to the IR, but opened during the recharge cycle. Ended up in a neutral state

***** Test 2
ATP Closed to IR, recharged slightly, reclosed to IR, then issued a Fail to Transfer alarm at the IR Controller. ATP then reclosed one (two) times?

***** Test 3
ATP sucessfully closed to IR bus.
***** Test 4
ATP failed to latch on the first attemp, but latched on the second close attempt.

***** Initial Testing conclusions
It appears that the breaker is very low on excess energy, most likely around ~1J. With the breaker operating in four different modes, it only *failed* fully on the first ATP Transfer test.

It was *very* important that the first test be monitored by the oscilloscope in order to capture the failure mode.

**** Possible Mitigation?
Spare CR5 Relay on the M340 DO Module - 24V DC Interposing relays
Using 125V DC Control Power for all relays.
Will need to evaluate wiring changes for circuit. Difficulty due to wiring runs.


**** General Comments
1. CHG DCOps did not have a lock-out procedure nor did they manitain the boundaries while the door was open. Where was the procedure?
2. Lockout procedure? Contractors not briefed, nor did they give them a key to lockout with.

**** Questions?
1. External DC Control power? Lockout only locked out both normal & IR power. Dual 110V DC sources are available in the system. Should probably be locked out since they are just turning off the MCB's inside the cabinet.

******** Results & Comments
********* COMMENT Run 1: Complete
Slow open fail worked properly on the IR, but if Normal Voltage returns, the ATP will re-close to the Normal. Problem is neither breaker can recharge because CR5 is in, which prevents either from recharging. A second attempt to reclose to IR will fail, resulting in a dead bus.
********* FAIL Run 2: Successfully closed
********* PASS Run 3: Slow Open Fail
Still respects inhibit. If NORMAL comes back, it will close to NORMAL.
********* FAIL Run 43 (Voltage): Slow Fail but did not close back to Alternate (IR)
********* FAIL Run 44 (Voltage): Immediate Fail
********* PASS Run 45 (Voltage): Slow Open Fail #4 w/ Fail to Close HMI Error Message
********* PASS Run 46 (Voltage): Slow Open Fail #5 w/ Fail to Close HMI Error Message
********* AI Run 47 (PSS): Slow Open Fail #6 w/Fail to Close HMI Error Message
When the failure occurs, CR5 is activated, but the PSS will still allow transfer back to the Normal Source. The HMI Alarm is locked in and will result in a dead bus condition if you attempt to transfer back to the IR a second time. Need to reset the HMI to reset CR5.

Will need to brief DCOps on how to recover via PSS failure.

No IR Request is issued when the PLC boots up. The Global PLC would apply the inhibit as soon as the ATP boots up, which would kick the ATP off the bus since TDES never counts down.

Failures appear to block the IR Request
********* PASS Run 3 (Voltage): Immediate Fail
********* PASS Run 4 (Voltage): Immediate Fail
********* PASS Run 5 (Voltage): Immediate Fail
********* PASS Run 6 (Voltage): Successful Close
********* PASS Run 7 (Voltage): Successful Close (1.5J)
********* FAIL Run 8 (Voltage): Slow Open Fail (titch under 2, 1.9) but did not wait 6.0 seconds after start of charging motor
PLC appeared that it did not wait full 6 seconds after the beginning of the charge to allow a re-close. It closed two (2) seconds after identifying the Slow Open Failure. Going to redo with a timer to verify time.
********* PASS Run 9 (Voltage): Successful Close
********* PASS Run 10 (Voltage): Successful Close
********* FAIL Run 11 (Voltage): Slow Open Fail but did not wait 6.0 seconds after start of charging motor
********* FAIL Run 12 (Voltage): Slow Open Fail but did not wait 6.0 seconds after start of charging motor
********* FAIL Run 13 (Voltage): Slow Open Fail but did not wait 6.0 seconds after start of charging motor
********* PASS Run 14 (Voltage): Successful Close
********* PASS Run 15 (Voltage): Immediate Fail
It was determined that the second re-close attempt was messing with the Slow Open Failure re-close.
********* PASS Run 16 (Voltage): Successful Close
********* PASS Run 17 (Voltage): Successful Close
********* FAIL Run 18 (Voltage): Slow Open Failure but no CR5 activation and re-close was too early
********* PASS Run 19 (Voltage): Successful Close
********* PASS Run 20 (Voltage): Immediate Fail
********* FAIL Run 21 (Voltage): Slow Open Fail but did not reclose to NORMAL. Closed to IR.
Programmer screwed with timing instead of leaving it along
********* PASS Run 22 (Voltage): Successful Close
********* FAIL Run 23 (Voltage): Slow Fail but CR5 activated too early
********* FAIL Run 24 (Voltage): PLC Failure when attempting to close due to Programmer updating
********* PASS Run 25 (Voltage): Successful Close
********* PASS Run 26 (Voltage): Successful Close
********* FAIL Run 27 (Voltage): Slow Open Failure but closed at 7.5s due to no B contact. ACB Alternate attempted to re-close due to old code. Needs to be fixed.
********* FAIL Run 28 (Voltage): Slow Open Fail but ATP Trouble Signal did not go away... so close!!!
********* PASS Run 29 (Voltage): Successful Close
********* AI Run 30 (Voltage): Immediate Fail with Fail to Close
Should not have multiple errors. Only one error.
********* PASS Run 31 (Voltage): Successful Close

****** Questions & Comments
******* AI How do we clear the alarm?
To clear the alarm, press the RESET button on the HMI MODULE on the front of the ATP.
******* AI When IMMEDIATE/SLOW FAIL alarm is cleared, a dead bus condition results when NORMAL voltage is not available.
When the alarm is cleared, with no voltage available on the NORMAL bus, the ATP did not attempt to close to the IR. Ending up with a dead bus. 
******* COMMENT Does the ATP still respect the INHIBIT? 
******* AI Add HMI Alarms

  3. Discussion
     1. Item 5: Foxbat Stick Built Project Specific
        1. Question still outstanding on whether the SEL-411L should be built into the design. 411L is normally tied to the SDC/SDT package. Darren still needs to follow up on PRY 5B MDC.
     2. Item 8: Load Bank
        1. Preference is to not have the load bank on the roof, but no one from PYR DCOps was present for the discussion.
        2. Discussed common output from load bank USS (4000A) to CCNR generators
        3. Add portable load bank connection (or backfeed gen). Need to add an isolating breaker (52-X), with control power derived from the permanently installed load bank.
        4. Common kirk-key interlock LV breaker of LB USS to CCNR Riser doors.
     3. Item 24: Load Bank Riser
        1. [AMP] For Oberlin or Berlin Style Builds w/indoor, 2nd story generators, provide neutral in load-bank riser diagram to facilitate back-feeding to 416V 3ph/4w 52-X from on-grade roll-up load. Also provide 52-X isolating breaker at roll-up generator location.
     4. Item 20: Inspection Windows for MV cable Lugs
        1. Shall be added to the Wire & Cable spec & for the ATP spec
     5. Item 21: Inspection Windows for MV Cable Lugs
        1. Paul Bern wanted to know if this was going to be done at SLN 3A, and I said in no uncertain terms that it would not be a full implementation pilot for a project, but rather evaluated internally. Mark Gallacher also strongly objected and said it would unecessarily complicate the installation for very little added value.
     6. Item 23: Isolation connector for DC battery systems
        1. Still need to decide if wanted. Never fully implemented at MNK6C

*** MTZ Low Voltage Circuit Breaker Workshop
**** Attendees
**** Introduction & Agenda Preview
**** Masterpact MTZ Test (Christian Bach)
***** Presentation Link: 
***** Introduction
Target is to validate previous NW tests
1. Busbar load tests on fix version
2. Integration tests inside switchboards Okken

Discussion on closing Excess Energy level & controls
***** Busbar Loading Test
Target:
+ Simulate Busbar loading effect on breakers
+ Combine mechanical loading (total 1500 lbs) & devices cycling (ATP transfer Simulation)

MTZ repeated original tests from the NW

Failure Occured at 11k operations, resetting mechanism failed.

***** MTZ Intergration into Okken
SETBT, Wren, France

Installed in same manner as normal integration, fixed contact. 2k size.

****** AI Method of Installation for SWBD Breakers
Procedure to verify the breaker is the last point of contact of assembly
***** Excess Energy Discussion
Similar architecture to MTZ, all MP+ improvements implied

Process Improvements:
1. Fully automated EE tool implemented in the manufacturing process
2. Using force sensor for better accuracy
3. Excess engergy is actually recorded against the serial number
4. Overtravel measurements: Each finger of each pole is verified
5. Multiple steps: Breaker 12-16J, Switch 15-18J
6. Overtravel: Depends on the product, but MTZ is between 3.8-5.0mm

Q: Calibartion of the tool how often?
A: Using force sensor and calibrated every 2 years. Repeatability improved from 0.5J to 0.05J

Q: Which & where is this tool being used?
A: Mastertech in France for both MTZ & NW, MTZ in China & India
****** AI Do we want to have EE measured at the field still? Are the improvements enough?
Robustness of the mechanism has reduced the sensititivy to EE on the design.
****** AI SE wants Cumberland Good to accept the following:
1. Keep EE measurements done at 100% in SE plant only for all MTZ breakers (IEC & UL)
2. Target a standardized EE range at 12-17J
****** AI Proper assembly procedure for Internal & External vendors
1. Want to see SE's process, procedure for installation.
2. External vendor guidance: How do you inform your 3rd party OEMs how to properly install.
**** Coffee Break
**** Masterpact MTZ Lab Visit

CLOCK: [2019-05-02 Thu 07:21]--[2019-05-02 Thu 12:41] =>  5:20
:END:
1. Still cannot remove closing spring without either lifting the breaker or removing of the breaker.
2. Charging Handle now has skin removal covering
3. Removable terminal block waygos appear to be a differnt supplier from the UL/ANSI product. They click into place securely much more so than the US version.
4. Replacement of the trip unit requires a small tool or screwdriver to remove the back cover to access the plugs.
5. Removal of the trip unit requires clipping of a zip tie near the bundle of small wires to disconnect. Recommended they add some sort of protection to prevent possible damage due to nippers or clippers when trying to remove zip tie. Very delicate.
6. *No secondary injection is capable on the MTZ trip units anymore. It's a USB test kit that feeds a digital value downstream of the A/D converter. Even worse, the USB test kit is not in the direct line of the primary -> secondary -> ASIC. May require modification of our commissioning plan to include primary injection at 2000A or higher.*
7. Front display is replaceable without needing to power off the breaker. 12kV Class II. Only low-voltage contacts.
8. Front display is also where the wireless radios reside, bluetooth & NFC.
9. Not all MTZ's had the improved fixed contacts. Date code after January 2019 have it implemented.
10. Instantaneous Operate is the setting.
11. Logs are useless. They don't actually contain values.
***** Mobile Device App
1. Masterpact Operation Assistant is required for mobile operation.
2. Mobile Device App has better logging.
3. Blue Light on ERMS. Actually very nice.
4. Can disable remote IFE programming, but can still change settings by phone with password. Ops may like this option.
5. Digital Local/Remote switch is a bad idea.
6. Not designed by an application engineer who knows operations.
***** EcoStructure Power Commission Tool
1. No licensing required, only registration.
2. Can be done via USB or Ethernet. Can gather firmware version, settings.
3. Testing done via USB only. Settings can be ready by Ethernet.
4. ERMS requires I/O Module or ESM (ERMS switch module), we will use I/O Module. M2C will remain.
***** Bluetooth & Zigbee
1. Requires pairing using the Customer Tool, requires laptop to enable.
2. Bluetooth disabled by default.
3. NFC can operate even when the Micrologic is powered off for last trip event.
4. Radios contained within the display.
5. SE is proposing using the Microprocessor One Time Programming sets the reset of the Wireless Chips (Bluetooth
****** AI Need Bluetooth/Zigbee Presentation
***** MTZ Control Unit Replacement (Bruno)
What nees to be set on a new control unit?
1. Breaker Parameters
2. Custom Settings & Protection.

Replacement Process
1. Removal of existing control unit
2. Download existing control unit parameters through EcoReach software (USB)
3. Upload parameters to the new control unit through EcoReach software (USB)
4. Install new control unit in the device
5. Perform functional tests (control unit internal tests, forced trip, communication, I/Os, power supply)

Estimated to be done by SE services. Open for discussion.

(Q) Sensors more accurate in the MTZ vs NW? No, just calibrated. Uses an engineering tool in the factory. Non-user accessible setting for the calibration data.

Certified Partner Training except for L4 Maintenance. I recommended that they may be open to partner training for L4 maintenace, especially for 5 year maintenance. Will get expensive.

Recommended we bring in Operations Maintenance, Engineering & Quality to discuss.

Mardix PPK2, breaker was defective, probably not the trip unit.

I informed them we won't be deploying MTZ's in the near future until 100kA Icw.

FFTK being obseleted. Breaker Test Module (BTM) will be required for the future.
****** AI MTZ & NW Maintanence Summit
SE wants to bring the regions together to discuss long term support.
